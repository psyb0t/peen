elelem is LLM, spelled out loud. Say it fast, you get it.

A Go engine for talking to LLMs that doesn't give a shit which one. Streaming,
tool loops, history that actually fits in the context window, retries that
don't hand your user the same fucking paragraph twice, and typed structured
responses. Swap OpenAI for Anthropic by changing one line; the rest of your
code never finds out it happened.

It's a library, not a framework — the difference being who owns the `for` loop.
Here, you do. `Run` hands you the tool calls and stops; the engine only drives
the loop if you explicitly ask for it with `WithAutoToolCalls()`. That order is
deliberate, because the second a human has to approve a tool call, "just
describe your goal, bro" abstractions stop being able to express the program
you actually need.

So: no planner, no memory store, no chain-of-anything, no swarm, no crew, no
graph of nodes that's secretly a `for` loop with extra steps. It also stores
nothing, picks no driver, resolves no credentials, discovers no external tools,
decides who may call which tool exactly fucking never, and renders nothing to a
user — no config loader, no `init()` quietly rummaging through your
environment. You wire it, it runs requests. Agent frameworks are one `go get`
and several regrets away, and this is the layer they'd be sitting on.

Built on the official `openai-go` and `anthropic-sdk-go`, plus an embedded
`o200k_base` tokenizer so budgeting doesn't need the network. 247 tests at 90%+
coverage, and both shipped drivers run the same conformance suite a third-party
driver would — the `Driver` contract is executable, not aspirational bullshit
in a markdown file.

```go
driver := openai.NewDriver(openai.WithAPIKey(apiKey))
client := elelem.New(driver)

response, err := elelem.NewRequest(client).
	WithModel(elelem.Model{ID: "some-model-id", ContextSize: 200_000}).
	WithPrompt(elelem.NewPrompt().
		WithSystem("You are a concise operations assistant.").
		UserText("Summarize the current incident state.")).
	Run(ctx)
```

## Quick start

```bash
go get github.com/psyb0t/elelem
```

Anthropic is the same as the example above, just a different constructor:

```go
driver := anthropic.NewDriver(anthropic.WithAPIKey(apiKey))
```

Wrap the driver and you get retries with backoff:

```go
client := elelem.New(elelem.WithRetry(driver, elelem.RetryConfig{MaxAttempts: 3}))
```

Streaming, a tool loop and a budget — still one chain, no ceremony:

```go
response, err := elelem.NewRequest(client).
	WithModel(model).
	WithPrompt(elelem.NewPrompt().UserText(question)).
	WithTools(tools).
	WithAutoToolCalls().          // without this YOU drive the loop
	WithMaxRounds(8).
	WithMaxContextTokens(100_000).
	OnText(func(_ context.Context, delta elelem.TextDelta) error {
		fmt.Print(delta.Text)

		return nil
	}).
	Run(ctx)
```

`Run` sends the tools; `WithAutoToolCalls` is what makes the engine execute
them. Manual driving is the default — drop that one line and the tool calls
come back to you, to approve or tell to fuck off.

Want the model to fill in a struct instead? `RunInto(ctx, &dst)`. Same builder,
typed answer, and it validates before it assigns, so a half-decoded object
never lands in your variable.

Every knob these examples don't show is in
[docs/requests.md](docs/requests.md).

## The pieces

| Area | What you get |
|---|---|
| **[Requests](docs/requests.md)** | `Client` + `Request` + the round loop. One chained builder for streaming, tools, history budgets, generation parameters, and per-provider escape hatches. Nothing here knows which vendor answers. |
| **[Prompts](docs/prompts.md)** | An immutable `Prompt` carrying the system message, the history and this turn — build it once, run it against several models from several goroutines. Images, audio and documents are content parts on a user message, and content the model can't read gets refused locally instead of by the provider a round trip later. |
| **[Tools](docs/tools.md)** | Bounded concurrency, per-tool timeouts, a `PreRun → Handler → OnSuccess\|OnError → PostRun` lifecycle, panic recovery that becomes a tool error instead of taking your process down with it, per-call denial, and tools that inject messages. |
| **[Callbacks](docs/callbacks.md)** | Sixteen observation points — run and round lifecycle, text and reasoning deltas, tool-call start/fragment/result, retries, token limits. Delivery stays ordered even when tools run concurrently. |
| **[History](docs/history.md)** | Counts the transcript, drops whole units oldest-first, never orphans a tool result. Replace the default sliding window with your own compaction in one call. |
| **[Retries](docs/retries.md)** | A decorator around any `Driver`. Classifies failures, honors `Retry-After`, stops the instant output starts streaming, and keeps a ledger of what the failed attempts cost you. |
| **[Structured output](docs/structured-output.md)** | `RunInto` derives a JSON schema from your own struct, validates against it, and can spend one bounded repair request when the model shits out malformed JSON. |
| **[Drivers](docs/drivers.md)** | OpenAI-compatible and Anthropic transports. `KnownModels()` / `LookupModel(id)` for pre-filled models; unknown ids stay usable, so this morning's release works today. |
| **[Test doubles](docs/testing.md)** | A scripted `Driver` that imports no test framework, a generated mock, and the conformance suite for when you write a third driver. |

## Drivers

Both drivers take the same four options and expose the same surface:

```go
openai.NewDriver(
	openai.WithAPIKey(apiKey),
	openai.WithBaseURL("https://your-openai-compatible-endpoint/v1"),
	openai.WithHTTPClient(httpClient),
	openai.WithSDKOptions(/* raw SDK options */),
)
```

`NewDriver` is convenient for a one-provider program: the official SDK can
read its usual environment variables. A multi-provider application that owns
credential resolution should start every configured driver with
`WithoutEnvironmentDefaults()`, then pass only that upstream's own key and
HTTP client plus a URL when it is not the driver's official default. That
stops one provider's environment credential from quietly reaching a keyless
local endpoint.

| | `drivers/openai` | `drivers/anthropic` |
|---|---|---|
| Talks to | OpenAI and anything OpenAI-shaped — vLLM, Ollama, OpenRouter, LM Studio, whatever proxy you cobbled together | The Anthropic Messages API |
| Model discovery | `ListModels(ctx)` live, plus `KnownModels()` / `LookupModel(id)` | same |
| Unknown model ids | accepted — the provider decides | accepted |

**Capabilities are per MODEL, not per provider.** `Driver.Capabilities(model)`
reports what one model supports — seed, tool choice, parallel tool calls,
strict tool arguments, JSON schema, sampling parameters, reasoning effort and
its ceiling. Anthropic rejects a non-default temperature on newer models while
happily eating it on older ones, so a single per-provider table would just be a
lie you shipped. The engine reads that struct and rejects an unsupported
parameter **locally**, before any network call, instead of firing it off and
eating a cryptic 400.

Streaming is on by default. Some OpenAI- and Anthropic-compatible backends
can't do it — an async job queue sitting in front of a model has nowhere to put
a token stream — so `WithStreaming(false)` sends the same request with
streaming off and feeds the finished response through the exact same callbacks.
Your renderer never has to know. See
[docs/requests.md](docs/requests.md#streaming).

Writing a third driver is [docs/drivers.md](docs/drivers.md), and
`elelemtest/conformance.Run` is the contract suite both shipped drivers run
against — so it's alive, not a document that quietly drifted out of date two
years ago.

## Shit that can bite you

Two inputs are untrusted, and nobody has to be malicious for it to matter — a
model that hallucinates, an OpenAI-compatible endpoint, or a proxy is plenty.

**Provider output.** Tool-call ids, names, arguments, indices and the finish
reason are all model-chosen. The engine bounds distinct tool calls per round
and accumulated argument bytes unconditionally. **Tool-result size is bounded
only if you ask** — `WithMaxToolResultTokens` is unset by default, and until
you set it a result goes through at whatever length it showed up. A call with
no id, a duplicate id, or an index reused for two different calls gets dropped
or split at ingest with a logged `reason` — because otherwise the provider
rejects each of those on the NEXT request instead of the one that produced it,
and good luck with that afternoon.

**Tool results.** A tool reads web pages, files and databases, so its output is
attacker-influenced content going straight into the model's context. The engine
**does not sanitize it, and does not bound it unless you set
`WithMaxToolResultTokens`**: a result saying "ignore your instructions" is
delivered exactly as written, at whatever length it arrived. Defending against
that is your fucking job, not the library's.

Three specifics worth knowing before you ship:

- **A tool can inject a system message.** That's the feature, and it means a
  tool is exactly as privileged as your system prompt — treat anything that can
  register one the way you'd treat a line in `sudoers`.
- **A handler's error text reaches the provider.** Handler errors become tool
  results the model reads, so a lazy `return err` from a failed database call
  will cheerfully post your connection string to somebody else's inference
  cluster.
- **`WithTimeout` is the only bound on an endless stream**, and it's unset by
  default. A provider that dribbles one token every thirty seconds will keep
  your goroutine company for as long as it damn well pleases.

API keys are never logged, and credentials embedded in a `WithBaseURL` endpoint
get stripped before the SDK sees them — the SDKs stuff the request URL into the
text of every error they build, and those errors get logged.

Full detail in [docs/tools.md](docs/tools.md).

## Logging

Structured `log/slog` through
[`ctxscope`](https://github.com/psyb0t/ctxscope), pulled from the
context — the library never takes a logger parameter and never installs a
global. Whatever you configured on `slog.Default()` at startup is where it
writes, and any scope attributes you set (`request_id`, `user_id`) ride along
on every line the engine emits.

It shuts up on purpose. DEBUG carries the per-round and per-tool detail. INFO
is spent on exactly two events — a transcript compacted to fit the budget, and
a stream that only survived because a retry saved its ass — because both are
things you want in a production log without flipping DEBUG on, and neither is
an error. WARN is the recoverable weirdness: a malformed tool call dropped at
ingest, a decision matching no pending call, an unknown tool requested, the
retry loop giving up. ERROR is shit that actually broke.

Compaction is INFO rather than WARN deliberately. It happens routinely on any
long conversation, and a WARN that fires on the normal path is exactly how a
log turns into noise nobody reads.

Every decision the engine makes quietly carries a `reason` field with a stable,
greppable value — `token_budget_exceeded`, `tool_call_denied`,
`max_attempts_exhausted`, `finish_reason_unmapped`, and so on. They're exported
as `elelem.LogReason*` constants, so your alerting matches the same symbol the
engine emits instead of some string you copy-pasted out of a log line and
typo'd.

## Package shape

A provider-neutral engine plus provider drivers. Your code holds
`elelem.Driver`, `elelem.Client` and `elelem.Request`; provider SDK types stay
locked inside their driver package and never leak out.

```text
client.go, request.go, engine.go   request construction and execution
driver.go, errors.go               provider boundary and sentinels
message.go, transcript.go          transcript primitives and repair
usage.go                           token and retry accounting
tool.go                            tools, hooks, and message injection
limit.go, tokens.go                history budgeting
retry.go                           retry decorator
structured.go                      typed structured responses
elelemtest/                        scripted Driver (imports no test framework)
elelemtest/conformance/            driver contract suite
elelemtest/mocks/                  generated Driver mock
drivers/openai/                    OpenAI-compatible transport
drivers/anthropic/                 Anthropic transport
```

Three placements the filename alone won't give you: the round/tool loop lives
in `engine.go`, every sentinel this package exports lives in `errors.go` (each
driver package has its own), and `structured.go` holds `RunInto` together with
the request-validation helpers it shares with `request.go`.
